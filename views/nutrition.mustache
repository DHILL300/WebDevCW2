     <div><h3>Fats</h3><br>
    <p>Fats are a type of nutrient that you get from your diet. It is essential to eat some fats, though it is also harmful to eat too much. The fats you eat give your body energy that it needs to work properly. During exercise, your body uses calories from carbohydrates you have eaten.</p>
