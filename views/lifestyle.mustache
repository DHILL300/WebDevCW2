<div class="text-center"><p>The Definition of a Healthy Lifestyle
Health refers to the absence of disease or abnormality on a physical, mental and emotional level.

It is also a state of balance and harmony within the body and between the body and its environment.

Lifestyle refers to the patterns of interaction between individuals and their environment, characterised by customs, habits, skills, and values that shape an individual's way of life.

The concept of health and lifestyle are multi-dimensional. Population health considers not only the health of individuals but also the health of populations and communities. This can provide insights into how to prevent or reduce health disparities among different groups.

A healthy lifestyle is defined as a pattern of living that helps maintain or improve one's health.

Some aspects of the flow of healthy living need extra care, attention and refining to achieve balance.

The interaction between an individual with a health condition and their environment is called disability. It encompasses:

physical and mental impairments associated with body function or structure
restrictions related to participation/involvement in life situations
limitations in activity correlating to the difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action
Disability, health, and lifestyle often go hand-in-hand; for example, someone with a disability may have poor health due to inactivity, while someone with a sedentary lifestyle may be at risk for developing obesity or heart disease. Disabilities can also lead to other morbidities.

Morbidity is a term used in medicine to refer to the state of being ill or diseased. It can also refer to the number of sick people in a population.

The Importance of a Healthy Lifestyle
If a person, group or community are not leading a healthy lifestyle, then the body stops functioning within optimal parameters and becomes (more) prone to transmissible and non-transmissible diseases. All bodily systems work together to achieve homeostasis.
